# Notes

- The distance values were rounded down for the sake of the graphs, however, in the algorithm the full value could be used.
- It's assumed that more buildings will result in more pedestrians, which would be an increase in risk.
- Both sides of the edge were taken into account when calculating the risk values, because it's assumed that dangers could appear from either side of the road.
- Flow chart doesn't include a part about what the current node is.
