    <h2>Deontology</h2>
    Follows deontology as it follows a rule based approach. The algorithm aims
    for the most safe routes, however, it would take a more dangerous route
    under extreme distance circumstances.
    <h2>Flow Charts</h2>

      Distance was found through the x and y coordinates of the points (in
      pixels) and using the distance between two points formula. Once the
      distance and risk have been calculated, add them together to get the
      combined distance risk number.
