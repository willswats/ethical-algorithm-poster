        <figcaption>
          The flow chart displays how the risk of each edge was allocated. The
          combined distance and risk was found by adding the risk onto the
          distance.

        <figcaption>
          The distance of each edge was found by plotting the x and y
          co-ordinates of the corresponding nodes (in pixels), and then by
          using the distance formula.

          Dijkstra's Algorithm was used to find the shortest route, based upon
          the allocated combined distance and risk of each edge.

        <figcaption>
          Town 1 has it's edges marked with the combined distance and risk
          values. These values are lower on the edges surrounded by green
          (safe) zones, and higher in more dangerous zones (blue and red),
          unless a green zone is exceedingly longer than a blue or red zone.

          Town 2 has been marked with the combined distance and risk values as
          well, proving that the algorithm could be applied to any other town.

        <h2>Ethical Theory</h2>
        <figcaption>
          The Algorithm follows Deontology as the combined distance and risk
          values were created based upon a set of rules. The algorithm aims to
          find a middle ground between safety and getting to a location in a
          reasonable amount of time.
