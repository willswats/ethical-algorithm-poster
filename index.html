        <figcaption>
          The flow chart displays how the risk of each edge was allocated.
          Once the risk is allocated it can be added on to the distance to
          find the combined distance risk. The distance was found by plotting
          the x and y co-ordinates of each of the points in pixels, and then
          by using the distance formula as show below.

          The flow chart displays Dijkstra's Algorithm. Dijkstra's Algorithm
          was used to find the shortest route, based upon the allocated
          combined distance and risk of each edge.

          As seen in the figure, town 1 has it's edges marked with the
          combined distance and risk values. These Risk values prioritise the
          safe routes, except for where the safe routes are exceedingly longer
          than a more dangerous route.

          The algorithm follows the ethical theory of Deontology as the
