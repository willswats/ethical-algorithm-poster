        <figcaption>
          The flow chart displays how the risk of each edge was allocated. The
          combined distance and risk was found by adding the risk onto the
          distance.

        <figcaption>
          The distance of each edge was found by plotting the x and y
          co-ordinates of the corresponding nodes (in pixels), and then by
          using the distance formula.

        <figcaption>
          Dijkstra's Algorithm was used to find the shortest route, based upon
          the allocated combined distance and risk of each edge.

        <figcaption>
          Town 1 has it's edges marked with the combined distance and risk
          values. These values are typically lower on the edges surrounded by
          green (safe) zones, and higher in more dangerous zones (blue and
          red).

          Town 2 has been marked with the combined distance and risk values as
          well, proving that the algorithm could be applied to any other town.

        <h2>Ethical Theory</h2>
        <figcaption>
          The Algorithm follows Deontology as it follows a set of rules that
          will typically result in a safe route being chosen over a more
          dangerous route. The algorithm aims to find a middle ground between
          safety and getting to a location in a reasonable amount of time.
